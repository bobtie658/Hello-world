\section{1. The Relational Model}
\subsection{EX1}
dataSet(dateRep(date), day(int), month(int), year(int), cases(int), deaths(int), countriesAndTerritories(varchar(255)), geoId(varchar(255)), countryterritoryCode(varchar(3)), popData2018(int), continentExp(varchar(255)))\\

\subsection{EX2}
I can't use the arrow symbol in latex, so I will replace it with "points to". I also couldn't use the squiggly brackets in latex.\\
I am making the assumption that popData2018 will be updated with new population data, meaning in the future two countries may have the same population. I am also assuming that no countries share a name.\\
I created a new attribute in order to differentiate the country codes, geoId and population counts from other countries as some of them are unknown.\\
dateRep points to day, month, year\\
day\\
month\\
year\\
cases\\
deaths\\
countriesAndTerritories points to geoId, dataKey, countryterritoryCode, popData2018, continentExp\\
geoId points to countriesAndTerritories, dataKey, countryterritoryCode, popData2018, continentExp (one territory has N/A as its geoId, so geoId shouldnt be relied on)\\
dataKey points to countryterritoryCode and popData2018\\
countryterritoryCode\\
popData2018\\
continentExp\\


\subsection{EX3}
dateRep, countriesAndTerritories\\
dateRep, dataKey\\
day, month, year, countriesAndTerritories\\
day, month, year, dataKey\\

\subsection{EX4}
dateRep, countriesAndTerritories\\
I will use this composite key as a primary key as it allows for all of the columns to be accessed as the country name is unique per country and the date only occurs once for each country.\\
I cannot use the country code or geoId as there are some territories which do not have one.\\

\section{2. Normalization}
\subsection{EX5}
There are two partial dependencies, dataKey and continentExp rely only on countriesAndTerritories.\\
day, moth and year all rely on dateRep.\\
\subsection{EX6}
casesAndDeaths\\
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
dateRep & countriesAndTerritories & cases & deaths \\
\hline
    [key]date & [key]varchar(255) & int & int\\
\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\\\
date\\
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
    dateRep & day & month & year \\
    \hline
    [key]date & int & int & int \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}\\\\\\
countries\\
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
    countriesAndTerritories & geoId & dataKey & countryterritoryCode & popData2018 & continentExp \\
    \hline
    [key]varchar(255) & varchar(255) & int & varchar(3) & int & varchar(255)\\
    \hline
\end{tabular}\\\\\\
\subsection{EX7}
geoId, countryterritoryCode and popData2018 rely on dataKey.\\
\subsection{EX8}
Remove geoId, countryterritoryCode and popData2018 from the last relation and include a new relation.\\\\
countryData\\
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
    dataKey & geoId & countryterritoryCode & popData2018\\
     \hline
    [key]int & varchar(255) & varchar(3) & int \\
     \hline
\end{tabular}\\
\subsection{EX9}
Yes, neither of the parts of the parts of the candidate keys are dependent on any other attributes.

\section{3. Modelling}
\subsection{EX10}
dataset.sql is included in the tar.gz.\\

\subsection{EX11}
I have made countriesAndTerritories the primary key of countries\\
dateRep is the primary key of date\\
dataKey is the primary key of countryData\\
countries includes dataKey as a foreign key\\
casesAndDeaths includes countriesAndTerritories and dateRep as foreign keys\\
ex11.sql is included in the tar.gz.\\

\subsection{EX12}
ex12.sql is included in the tar.gz.\\

\subsection{EX13}
It is possible to read dataset.sql, followed by ex11.sql and ex12.sql to get the complete database.\\

\section{4. Querying}
\subsection{EX14}
ex14.sql is included.\\

\subsection{EX15}
ex15.sql is included.\\

\subsection{EX16}
ex16.sql is inlucded.\\

\subsection{EX17}
ex17.sql is included.\\

\subsection{EX18}
ex18.sql is included.\\

\subsection{EX19}
ex19.sql is included.\\
Uses window functions.\\
