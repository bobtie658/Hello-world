# Clicker game by Bobtie


mons = 0    # sets variable for money to 0
machine = 0 # sets variable for robots to 0
upgrade = 1 # instead of having a variable for how much each click is worth and the number of upgrades seperate, i combined them so it would take less space
            # by having upgrade set to 1, each click will be worth 1 mons
loop = 0    # the loop variable is just used to create an infinate loop easily and quickly, there is most definatly a better way of doing it, but its the first thing i thought of
tally = 0   # this is used so every 10 clicks, it will display the money earned and every 50 clicks, the robots will activate
mprice = 500   # these prices are used as a base value for the price of each thing you can buy
uprice = 100
muprice = 1000
mupgrade = 10   # mupgrade is the same as the upgrade, with the same idea to save number of variables, but this is a upgrade for robots
